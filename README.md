# TriviaGame


Conclusion:

First off I would like to apologize to the TA grading this assignment... I definitely let myself go on this one (due to being unable to attempt the previous RPG assignment.) I experimented with many different concepts and played with different ideas. I know alot of the techniques I used were probably a little unorthodox, but nevertheless I had fun playing around with values/theories/ideas and skinned many cats, many ways. I tried to think up ways to fix the problems I would run into without just googling, which I felt helped me better understand the limitations and expectations in my coding. I experimented with addClass/removeClass, timers, multi-background-image layering, and objects/arrays, amoung other things. I also was able to implement media queries! I spent 30+ hrs on this assignment, but mostly with playing with ideas and experimenting. I was able to get the main functioning js logic down within 6-8hrs which I felt was a huge improvement from previous js HW. Im thrilled with how far I've come in just 6weeks of class. Also sidenote - I am terrible at git pushing to save... I need to push it more, I think I only made 2 pushes total... I need to think salt n peppa...
